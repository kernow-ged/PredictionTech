<h1 align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>PredictionTech 
  1.0</b></font></h1>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The PredictionTech 1.0 package consists of two Android applications and this PDF document. With these two applications you will be able to apparently predict thoughts, decisions and events, secretly communicate with a partner, perform card effects without a deck of cards and more. In some of the effects explained in this document, your smartphone is 
brought out into play, and in others it remains entirely hidden so that no one need know you are even carrying a phone.</font></p>
<h1 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">PWEngine.apk</font></h1>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">PWEngine 
  (the main app) is an application that enables you to pocket-write using your 
  Android device. By tracing numerals and letters on the screen with your finger 
  when the device (and your hand) are inside your pocket, you can secretly enter 
  information and deploy it while simply appearing to be in a casual, hands-in-pocket 
  stance. You can change your home screen wallpaper to one of many indexed images 
  secretly while the device is in your pocket, you can write numbers or words 
  and send them off to a Web application of your choosing to be acted upon, and 
  there will be other avenues to deploy pocket-written information in future revisions. 
  If you have used an app like Google's Gesture Search, this works on a similar 
  principle except the interface is vastly simplified to facilitate hidden operation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>SimpleThumper.apk</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It 
  is not absolutely essential to install this app unless you find a use for it. 
  This second package (<b>SimpleThumper.apk</b>) is designed to work with the 
  system. You can install this app on the Android phone of a spouse, trusted friend 
  or partner. They will need some practice in order to work with the thumper. 
  This app is explained later in <b>Appendix A</b> of this document; suffice it 
  to say for now you can pocket-write words and numbers invisibly using the PWEngine app, and have them 
  sent to the thumper on a second phone for secret communication. Both people 
  need to be connected to the Web to do this; it is an Internet-mediated simple 
  message service. Very simple in fact!</font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FF0000">PWEngine: 
  Installation</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This app is not 
  offered through the Android Market, for reasons of secrecy and exclusivity. 
  We only want people who are serious about mentalism to use this utility. Moreover, 
  there are a couple of example Web-based effects incorporated with this app that 
  have been personalised for each user. This means that you will have to set your 
  Android device to &quot;install non-Market apps&quot; if you have not done so 
  already. One guide to the correct settings to do so is at <a href="http://pocketnow.com/how-to/how-to-install-non-market-apps-on-your-android-phone">http://pocketnow.com/how-to/how-to-install-non-market-apps-on-your-android-phone</a> 
  <br>
  Now you may use your sync software or email program to download the <b>PWEngine.apk</b> 
  file onto your device. You should get a &quot;notification&quot; letting you 
  know the file is in your SD card's &quot;download&quot; location. You can click 
  on the notification and the app should start installing. Contact me at <a href="mailto:ged_grey@yahoo.co.uk">ged_grey@yahoo.co.uk</a> 
  if you have any problems with this step.<br>
  <br>
  <b>PWEngine.apk</b> asks for several permissions to use various features. I 
  shall tell you exactly how it uses these permissions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Write to SD 
  card</b>: to make a folder <b>PWEngine-images</b> on your SD card where it will 
  search for user-defined wallpapers (see effect later in this document).<br>
  <b>Internet: </b>to optionally deploy pocket-written information to a Web resource 
  of your choice, <s>and to optionally use a Bing&#153; spell checker</s>*.<br>
  <b>Vibrate:</b> to optionally provide tactile feedback in Morse code or binary 
  number representations, or to confirm certain actions. <br>
  <b>Set wallpaper:</b> to optionally change your home screen wallpaper in the 
  service of an effect described below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The app should 
  install on your SD card if you are running Android 2.2 or higher, along with 
  the sample wallpapers that make up the bulk of the package.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">*Recently the 
  spell-checker was pulled by Microsoft. But see below for another way to spell-check, 
  even with numbers!</font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FF0000">PWEngine: 
  Operation</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Your 
  installer should offer you the option to run the program straight away, or you 
  may run it later by tapping on the PWEngine icon. Align your device so the title 
  bar is at the top. PWEngine defaults to landscape view so you should be turning 
  your device sideways at this point. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="webimg/screen1.png" width="476" height="293"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
  <br>
  This minimalist screen is what you draw on; first you will be wanting to check 
  it out in front of you. Later on, when you get the gist of how it works, you 
  can easily use this app to input data secretly from inside your pocket. Go ahead 
  and trace a line down the middle of the screen: </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="webimg/screen2.png" width="477" height="293"></font></p>
<p align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
  <br>
  This will fade quickly after tracing it. Now double tap the surface (a &quot;double 
  tap&quot; is two touches on the same spot of the surface in quick succession, 
  analogous to a &quot;double click&quot; on a mouse button). This &quot;commits&quot; 
  the writing - i.e. it lets the device know that you have finished entering your 
  numbers or letters. Currently, this secretly-entered information can be deployed 
  in a few ways which are described in <b>Menu&gt;Output mode</b> below. By default 
  the app is set up for <b>Test mode</b>. Double tap on the screen now, you should 
  see:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="webimg/screen3.png" width="477" height="296"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
  is <b>Test mode</b>: don't worry, we can do some more impressive things than 
  this, which we'll get to very shortly! Double tap on this new screen to return 
  to the writing surface. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now 
  you can experiment with entering some more numbers, thus (follow the direction 
  of the arrows, start at the &quot;blob&quot; and trace the numeral without lifting 
  your finger off the screen. Obviously, the blob and arrow are just there for 
  illustration and don't need to be drawn themselves!):</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="-1"><br>
  <img src="webimg/nums.jpg" width="689" height="374"> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
  Lift your finger off the writing surface briefly <i>after</i> inputting each 
  numeral. You can &quot;write over the top&quot; of previously entered numerals; 
  it makes no odds on a digital entry system like this. When you have written 
  the desired number, double tap to confirm it.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A 
  special entry symbol you might want to use is the &quot;reset&quot; symbol:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="webimg/reset.jpg" width="215" height="168"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If 
  you feel you have made a mistake, write this symbol to clear your number so 
  you can start again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><u>Letters</u></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
  you have <b>Menu&gt;Input mode</b> set to <b>Letters</b>, you may, in a similar 
  manner, write letters on the surface. The way to trace these letters are as 
  follows:</font></p>
<div align="center"> 
  <table width="69%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="736">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="webimg/letters-a-l.jpg" width="700" height="286"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="webimg/letters-m-r.jpg" width="751" height="165"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="webimg/letters-s-z.jpg" width="649" height="348"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p align="center">&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
  Again, a double tap commits your text for output.<br>
  <br>
  Also when in this mode of input, a <i>single</i> brief tap on the screen will 
  insert a space into your text. So you can write short phrases like forename/surname 
  combinations, adjective/noun combinations, and more.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
  reset symbol works the same as it does with numbers, clearing the memory so 
  you can start over:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="webimg/reset.jpg" width="215" height="168"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Also, 
  there is another symbol you can use in this mode, the backspace symbol, which 
  is drawn thus:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="webimg/backspace.jpg" width="180" height="173"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
  works in the same way as any backspace key; it will delete the last letter written 
  (e.g. <b>flint</b> becomes <b>flin</b>).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You 
  can set the orientation of the writing surface to Portrait or Landscape, whichever 
  is more convenient. I use Landscape when my phone is in my coat pocket and Portrait 
  for inside my jeans pocket. When you have got used to inputting numerals and 
  letters in plain sight, you will be wanting to practise with the device inside 
  your pocket in secrecy. There are some options for tactile feedback that you 
  can enable for practising in private. Or if you are practising your PWing in 
  public, one option is to simply pretend that you have received a text message, 
  whether you opt for visual feedback, tactile feedback, or both.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another 
  pocket-writing option I occasionally make use of, though this depends on your 
  performance attire, is to PW in the large &quot;pouch pocket&quot; of a hoodie. 
  This is very easy as both hands can meet and stabilise the writing surface.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">From 
  the PWing surface, tap the Menu button to configure how you want to configure 
  PWEngine:<br>
  </font></p>
<h2 align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FF0000">PWEngine: 
  Menu</font></h2>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Set 
  orientation</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
  This locks the writing surface in either <b><u>Portrait</u></b> or <u><b>Landscape</b></u> 
  mode, depending on which option is checked.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Input 
  mode</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><u>Numerals</u></b><br>
  The default operation mode of this app, you can get an awful lot done with numbers, 
  just see Corinda step 8 for example. <br>
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><u>Letters</u></b><br>
  This may take more practice to get the letters down, especially when writing 
  in the pocket. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Output 
  mode</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><u><b>Test mode</b></u><br>
  When you double-tap the screen in test mode, your device displays the number 
  that it thinks you have written on the surface. Double-tap on this new screen 
  to dismiss it and return to the PWing surface.<br>
  You can also add vibration feedback by selecting <b>Options&gt;Auto-thump (in 
  test mode). </b><br>
  If you are inputting <b>letters</b>, the device will feed back your text (or 
  the app's interpretation thereof!) in Morse code.<br>
  Auto-thump will vibrate any written <b>number</b> in binary, from low to high 
  bits. A long vibration is a one, and a short vibration is a zero. <br>
  Example 1: the number 5 will be vibrated by long - short - long. This is in 
  reverse from how you would normally depict it visually, and sends the message 
  <i>"add 1, do not add 2, add 4".</i> <br>
  Example 2: the number 14 will be vibrated by short - long - long - long. Again, 
  this is in reverse from how you would normally see it depicted, and sends the 
  message <i>"do not add 1, add 2, add 4, add 8"</i>. The slider sets the speed 
  at which this thumping takes place. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <u><b>Wallpaper effect <br>
  </b></u>There are two settings for this effect, which you can see by going to 
  <b>Wallpaper location</b> on the menu. The default setting <b>Use preset (cards)</b> 
  refers to a sample effect with some images included with the app.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Use preset (cards):</b> This sample effect allows you to set any named (or 
  peeked*, etc.) card as your phone's wallpaper, in secrecy. The app then exits, 
  simulating a Home key press to take you back to the home screen, so you can 
  tap the power button to lock/standby your phone as you bring it out of your 
  pocket, and then when you subsequently unlock it, or even allow the other party 
  to do so, the home screen, with the playing card in question as a background, 
  is the first thing seen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Set <b>Input mode>Numerals 
  </b><br>
  Set <b>Output mode>Wallpaper effect </b><br>
  Set <b>Wallpaper location>Use preset (cards) <br>
  </b>Optionally, set <b>Options>Vibrate on wallpaper change </b><b> </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As I say this 
  last setting is enabled by default initially...<br>
  When using this preset, pocket-write a <b>number</b> between 1 and 52. Make 
  sure <b>Menu&gt;Input mode</b> is set to <b>Numbers</b>, else you will just 
  get the 52 card gag as explained below.<br>
  The number you write is best mentally determined thus: Ace is 1, two is 2, etc... 
  Jack being 11, Queen being 12 and King 13. <br>
  For the suit <b>Clubs</b>: add nothing <br>
  For the suit <b>Hearts</b>: add to 13 <br>
  For the suit <b>Spades</b>: add to 26 <br>
  For the suit <b>Diamonds</b>: add to 39 <br>
  Example 1:<i> the 7 of Spades is 7 + 26 = 33 <br>
  </i>Example 2:<i> the Queen of Hearts is 12 + 13 = 25 </i><br>
  You can always break the suit/card selection process down a bit if the in-performance 
  arithmetic is daunting at first. We all know that even the simplest of sums 
  and memory-recalls can go awry in the heat of the moment! By "breaking it down" 
  I mean, for example, asking one participant for a suit, getting your bearings 
  by mentally noting the suit-number needed, and asking another participant for 
  a value, then adding that to the suit-number. <br>
  When you then double-tap the screen, your number is translated to the appropriate 
  card, which is set as your phone's wallpaper. <br>
  In case of any serious confusion as to which number has been written by the 
  app, it will set as wallpaper the "52 card gag screen" which displays all the 
  cards in an albeit cramped fashion. Any number received over 52 will be treated 
  as 52 (King of Diamonds), and zero will activate the 52 card gag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">*For peeking and 
  billet work. I highly recommend Elliott Bresler's <i>Switchcraft</i> (<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/ebswitch/home">http://sites.google.com/site/ebswitch/home</a>). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Use own images:</b> 
  When the app is first run, it creates a folder on your SD card named <b>PWEngine-images</b>. 
  Whatever you place in here (as long as it is a JPG or PNG image!) will be used 
  for this effect when this setting is enabled. You can name them numerically 
  or with (lower-case) letters, but don't mix the two as there is not (yet) a 
  way to switch input modes in pocket-writing. In operation, you write the name 
  of the image file (not the &quot;.jpg&quot; or &quot;.png&quot; extension), 
  and the app will seek it out and set it as wallpaper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You can also add 
  the equivalent of a 52-card gag image to this folder. Name it "<b>default.jpg</b>". 
  If anything should go awry during the effect, like a mis-entered or mis-recognised 
  code, the app will set this image as your wallpaper. For example, you could 
  set the "baby gag" for a set of celebrity images. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Let us look at 
  an example index that is possible using this setting. Collect a number of JPG 
  images of animals off the Web, as many as you feel might contribute to a good 
  comprehensive index. <br>
  Rename an image of a cat <b>ca.jpg</b> <br>
  Rename an image of a cow <b>co.jpg</b> <br>
  Rename an image of a pig <b>pi.jpg</b> <br>
  Rename an image of an elephant <b>el.jpg</b> <br>
  <b>...</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You get the idea, 
  and if I mention <b>rh.jpg</b>, <b>ti.jpg</b>, <b>ho.jpg</b>, etc., you don't 
  have to be a mind reader to guess which animals I am referring to! Basically, 
  it is possible to index all the commonly-named animals by the first two letters. 
  Only way I can see you running into problems is if you add, for example, a camel 
  to your index, which will clash with "cat" for the filename <b>ca.jpg</b>. Well, 
  you can make a mental note of this clash and make two files named "<b>cam.jpg</b>" 
  and "<b>ca.jpg</b>", only an extra letter to contend with in the event that 
  someone should name "camel"... You may want to edit some of these pics so the 
  aspect ratio is close to that of your home screen (simple cropping should suffice).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Move all these 
  pics to the <b>PWEngine-images</b> folder on your SD card. <br>
  Set <b>Input mode>Letters </b><br>
  Set <b>Output mode>Wallpaper effect </b><br>
  Set <b>Wallpaper location>Use own images</b> <br>
  Optionally, set <b>Options>Vibrate on wallpaper change </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In practice, all 
  you need do now is write the first two (occasionally three) letters of the animal 
  name to the screen (e.g. <b>ca</b> for a cat), then double tap to set the wallpaper 
  and exit. Then tap the power button to lock as you extract the device from your 
  pocket and you are all set. It may take a couple of seconds for the app to set 
  the wallpaper especially with larger (in kilobytes) images, but by the time 
  you have the phone out it will have done it. If you have &quot;vibrate on wallpaper 
  change&quot; enabled, you don't have to wait for the vibration before tapping 
  the power button to lock, it will still be taking care of it as you bring the 
  phone out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My "default.jpg" 
  for the set of animal images is a stick-picture of a generic four-legged beast, 
  which could be just about anything with a bit of interpretative latitude. A 
  gag which I saw on Derren Brown's 2004 tour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you find that 
  the images are not tiling correctly, that is they are looking distorted or &quot;repeated&quot;, 
  see <b>Set home screen</b> below for information on how to adjust this. Also, 
  you may be able to add extra &quot;panels&quot; to your home screen, I have 
  one that is free of icons so the revealed image looks nicer. If I go to this 
  panel on my home screen and then access PWEngine from my app launcher, the system 
  takes me back to that uncluttered empty panel when the wallpaper is changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> <u><b>Transmit 
  by HTTP</b></u><br>
  When this option is selected, your device will be set up to send an HTTP GET 
  request including your pocket-written information as a parameter. Essentially 
  this means &quot;send whatever you PW out to your WWW page of choice.&quot;<br>
  You can see that if you set up a bespoke Web service that sets something in 
  motion depending on which parameter it receives, the sky is the limit. <br>
  <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Click on 
  <b>Options&gt;Edit URL</b> to do just that: you will see the sample URL: <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/cards/set.php?r1=zzz&n=###</b><br>
  If you like, you can change the URL to something of the form <i>http://mysecretmentalistsite.com/do_something.php?p=</i><b><i>###</i> 
  </b> <br>
  The '###' bit will be replaced with whatever you secretly write whilst in use. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Sample Web effect 1:</b> The sample URL is a simple Web service I have set 
  up to illustrate the process. As an example of an effect using this webservice, 
  you can perform a card prediction using a borrowed phone or tablet (or laptop, 
  even) and this preprogrammed URL. Your Android device is in your pocket and in 
  fact never comes into view. Borrow someone's phone/tablet with "Would you like 
  to see something? Do you mind if I look up a web page on your phone? Nothing 
  dodgy, I promise you! In fact, I'll show you in a second." </font></p>

  Set <b>Output mode>Transmit by HTTP</b><br>
  Optionally, set <b>Options>Vibrate on HTTP<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
  And, in performance, on their <i>own</i> device, type in the URL <b><a href="http://adniroc.co.uk/cards/index.php?r1=zzz">http://adniroc.co.uk/cards/index.php?r1=zzz</a></b> 
  (this is another URL for display purposes) when you open their device's browser. 
  You will see it opens and shows the "dummy" image of a 52 card gag. Lay their 
  device screen side down on the table with "But not yet. I'll tell you now, it's 
  a picture of a playing card." From here on in you are going to ask for, or peek, 
  or otherwise elicit from them a particular playing card. <br>
  Calculate the number as per the "wallpaper" sample card effect, and contrive to put your 
  hand in your pocket (putting a billet away for safekeeping, having peeked it, 
  is a good pretext!) When you PW and commit the number by double-tapping, your 
  device will activate a Web service that dynamically changes the image on their 
  phone from the joker to the card in question. It may take a few seconds, so 
  have a line or two ready before the denouement. The good thing is that your 
  participant can pick up their own device to see their card.<br>
  <br>
  A little note of caution here: like I say this is a very simple Web service, 
  and it is possible for someone tech-minded to subsequently look at the HTML 
  (and more importantly, Javascript) source code of the page <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/cards/index.php?r1=zzz</b>, 
  as the URL will be saved on the device, and deduce that &quot;something is up.&quot; 
  By which I mean there is no way of knowing about your PWing, but there is a 
  way to know that this page is set up to change images on the fly. This should 
  not be a problem for the vast majority of participants. If you want to set up 
  a script on your own website, you are very welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:ged_grey@yahoo.co.uk">ged_grey@yahoo.co.uk</a> 
  for some advice, which you can apply yourself or use in consulting with your

  this way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To set a new page

  and check out what happens when you repeat the effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I am now going 
  to describe a page where you can set up as many custom indexes as you like: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Using the same 
  page <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/leadin.php?r1=zzz&token=e55b7</b>, enter <font color="#0000FF"><b>http://adniroc.co.uk/indexing/index.php?r1=zzz&n=</b></font> 
  in the "Edit URL lead-in" box, and save. Don't worry about the other box for 
  now. You have just told the dummy page to redirect to the new indexing page. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But there is yet 
  another place to go, to make up your own indexes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/indexing/setup.php?r1=zzz&token=e55b7</b> 
  You might want to visit this page on a desktop or laptop rather than a phone, 
  for ease of editing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You will see a 
  sample index, of five ESP cards, and a "default" in case of emergency. You can 
  make and save new indexes with whatever you want. The default is a very simple 
  index that just shows how it works. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To "spell check" 
  words in an index, a method called Levenshtien's algorithm is used. This means 
  that if a couple of digits or letters get mis-recognised, the closest match 
  can be found. To use this method, do not include a default, else the default 
  will be used instead of the nearest match. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Take 
  the example file countries.txt, included in the zip file, which can just be 
  copied and pasted as-is into the text field of a new index. This example index 
  is 146 videos of different countries. Be sure to set <b>Input mode > Letters</b> 
  to use this one. If a letter or two is mis-recognised by the app, the service 
  upstream should be able to correct it: the use of Levenshtien's method here 
  is like using a dictionary consisting of only the names you have in the index.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Anti-skeptic 
  measures</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is possible 
  that someone may think that you are up to no good when asking to borrow their 
  phone and doing something on it out of their sight, even for a few seconds. 
  The popularity of R. Paul Wilson's <i>The Real Hustle</i> in the UK, for example, 
  means that many TV viewers have seen cases of dodgy scams being pulled off with 
  just a few seconds' access to the mark's device, on the pretext of asking for 
  a favour (of course, the mark is wised up afterwards.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Also, the dummy 
  page resides in global history (if private browsing is not switched on) although 
  it does not appear in the "local history" of the tab or window where the prediction 
  is loaded, so one cannot press the back button to discover it. Anyone suspicious 
  could go rooting around in the history to find a page which, although benign, 
  is mysterious, and might somewhat yield to the probing of someone versed in 
  Javascript. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On the page mentioned 
  before, where you set the URL to point to the custom index, there is another 
  option, to "edit HTML of dummy page". So, if you liked, you could make something 
  that is possible to flash momentarily, that looked like the destination page. 
  Also, you can embed said dummy page in an iframe on your own site; as ever, 
  if you need assistance doing this please drop me a line. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Secondly, you 
  can use an URL shortener, like they use on Twitter, to point to the page <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/async.php?r1=zzz</b> 
  Hand this shortened URL, on a business card, to someone and they can type it 
  into their phone or computer after you have done the dirty work. This "second 
  redirect", which is the one that <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/async.php?r1=zzz</b> 
  does, changes all the time according to pocket-written input. So the short URL 
  on the business card will also change. Now this means that it might not be a 
  good idea to let the participant keep the business card. Or, if you do, write 
  the short URL in disappearing ink or something <b>;)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Something to 
  be aware of re: the ESP symbols and other small indexes </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There is a slight 
  issue that would mainly affect small indexes. The thing is, the dummy page listens 
  out for changes since the last item entered. So if you were predicting one of 
  five ESP symbols twice in a row, there is the chance that you may be asked to 
  predict, for example, the wavy lines both times. The second time round no change 
  would register and therefore the page would not redirect. In practice, the ESP 
  symbols index was just given as a didactic example; I am supposing that people 
  would rather, as I do, take advantage of the larger "namespaces" afforded by 
  asking someone to name a year or something. If you perform a "time travel" item 
  twice in succession, the chances that you will be given the same year to predict 
  twice in a row are extremely remote. If this is a concern - between performances, 
  write some big random number that is far out of any discourse you could imagine, 
  and set this off (you don't need the dummy page open to do this!) The next time 
  this dummy page is loaded you will have ensured that it has this crazy number 
  in its memory; any number in the range you want to use will be therefore treated 
  as a change. </font></p>

  To make best use of this application you or your confederate are going to need 
  to have some skill with binary numbers and/or Morse code. Which may sound forbidding, 
  but bear in mind a pre-agreed-upon index of only a handful of options (signalled 
  by small binary numbers or single Morse letters) can make for a powerful demonstration. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Warning: 
  this may be a battery hog of an app, so make sure to have a nice full battery

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
  the receiver/psychic presses the "listen" button the app starts listening out 
  at an URL called <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/thump/check.php?r1=zzz&token=e55b7</b> 
  for new messages. This is preprogrammed into the SimpleThumper app so no need 
  to worry about it further.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Simply 
  pressing the Home key will cause SimpleThumper to stop listening for messages 
  and exit. <br>
  <br>
  The pocket-writer, or sender, is operating PWEngine in HTTP mode. He/she needs to set the output URL to <b>http://adniroc.co.uk/thump/send.php?r1=zzz&token=e55b7&n=###</b> 
  in the same way as when using any other of the example Web services 
  delineated previously (go to <b>Options-&gt;Edit URL</b>). Note the difference 
  between <b><i>set.php</i></b> (in the Web prediction already explained earlier) 
  and <i> <b>send.php</b></i> (this)... </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now 
  any pocket-written numbers or words are sent off to this Web intermediary where

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Phones 
  may differ in how audible they are in vibrating, even when concealed in clothing. 
  Experiment with ways of dampening the phone so the vibrations can be felt but 
  not heard by any other party. The phone running SimpleThumper will vibrate in 
  much the same way as PWEngine does in "autothump" setting (binary for numbers, 
  Morse code for letters). It determines the numerical or literal status of the 
  sent message automatically. Likewise, you can set the speed of thumping in the 
  menu (there is only one menu item at this time!). </font></p>

  it a go. I intend to add some code to dynamically generate wallpaper images
